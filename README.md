In this project we create a machine learning model that uses Supervised machine learning technique. 
Here, the dataset provided to us includes the list of students that studies hours/day in order to to get particular scores.
Our motive is to create a machine learning model and train it with the given data. 
So that, it can predict the score of a student given the number of hours they study per day.
